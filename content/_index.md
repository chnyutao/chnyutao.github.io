## About

Hi there! I am a PhD student in computer science at the University of Macau, where I am part of the [BOLT Lab](https://www.bolt-lab.org/) and supervised by [Dr. Steven Morad](https://www.dangersteve.com).

I am generally interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Specifically, my current research interests span **reinforcement learning** (RL), **continual learning** (CL), and world modeling with high-dimensional observations in the real world. I also apply Bayesian and probabilistic inference to the aforementioned topics.

From a more pholosophical perspective, my research interests are driven by the conviction that general intellligence should be capable of:
- Self-improving through few interactions with the environment (RL);
- Adapting to changing environments while minimizing forgetting (CL).

To this end, I am pursuing intelligent agents (with applications in **robotics**) that are capable of learning and adapting continually in the real world.
