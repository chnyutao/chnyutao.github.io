## About

Hi there! I am an incoming PhD student (starting Aug) in computer science at the University of Macau, where I am part of the [BOLT Lab](https://www.bolt-lab.org/) and supervised by [Dr. Steven Morad](https://www.dangersteve.com).

I am generally interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Specifically, my current research interests include _continual learning_ (CL), _reinforcement learning_ (RL), and world modelling with high-dimensional data in the real world. I also enjoy applying Bayesian and probabilistic techniques to the aforementioned topics.

From a more pholosophical perspective, my research interests are driven by the conviction that general intellligence should be capable of:
- Self-improving from experiences through interactions with the environment (RL);
- Evolving with changing environments without forgetting prior knowledge (CL).

Being able to self-improve and evolve is arguably one of the most important traits of intelligent beings, with us humans as one obvious example.
