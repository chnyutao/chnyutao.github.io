## About

I am an incoming PhD student (starting Aug) in computer science at the University of Macau, where I am part of the [BOLT Lab](https://www.bolt-lab.org/) and supervised by [Dr. Steven Morad](https://www.dangersteve.com). Before that I completed my master's degree at the Australian National University supervised by [Dr. Thang Bui](https://thangbui.github.io), and bachelor's degreee at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications supervised by Dr. Jinpeng Chen.

I research artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Specifically, my current research interests include **continual learning** (CL), **reinforcement learning** (RL), and more recently world modelling. I also enjoy applying Bayesian / probabilistic techniques to solving the aforementioned problems. From a higher perspective, I like
- Agent that can improve itself from environmental feedbacks with little supervision signal;
- Agent that can accomodate to evolving environments and learn incrementally without forgetting.
